# this interface defines a screen/board type in game
interface GameBoard
    class OverWorld (Singleton? cringe?)
    class Combat
    ShopScreen????

        player = Player # as in the player input/save file
        entities = [] # array of entities (objects in game)


# this class keeps track of and contains methods for things that are relevent to the human player
class Player

    summons = [] # array of summons in player's party
    inventory
    x_pos
    y_pos
    speed?


# this class keeps track od and contains methods for things that are relevent to a summoned character
class Summon

    moveset = [] # array of spells, skills
    type # elemental
    size? # maybe combat or effects are different based on size
    status # poisoned? flying?
        those are two different concepts (status condition, current status)
    


# this interface defines methods for abilities used by a Summon to attack
interface AttackAbility

    class Spell # use mana
    class Skill # use (something? nothing?)
        


how to represent skill/spell typing in data????
    def have it stored as a reference in instance variables

how to handle user input/abstract user input
    this allows cpu to use the same pathway

Should I have variables in the interface?
