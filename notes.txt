This is a single player RPG
- There needs to be an overworld with player inventory, settingse, menus, etc

figure out how the game loop should work
    it needs to be something that can enter into other modes ex: into the turn
        based combat upon begin encounter

figure out a better structure for player data

figure out better structure for character data

figure out better structure for character ability data

create a class diagram or something when it becomes necessary

Builder pattern?

maybe GameBoard will be an observer for the objects i name, who then give the instructions
